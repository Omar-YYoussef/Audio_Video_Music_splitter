# Omar-YYoussef-Audio/Music Splitter

This Streamlit application allows you to separate vocals from music in audio and video files. It uses the Demucs model for source separation and FFmpeg for audio and video processing.

## Features

*   **URL Processing:** Downloads and processes audio from video URLs (Facebook and other platforms supported by yt-dlp).
*   **Audio Processing:** Upload and process local audio files (MP3, WAV, OGG).
*   **Video Processing:** Upload and process local video files (MP4, MKV, AVI).
*   **Vocal Extraction:** Separates vocals from the instrumental track.
*   **Processed File Downloads:** Download the separated vocals, instrumental track, or the processed video with extracted vocals.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use tabbed interface powered by Streamlit.
*   **Dockerized:** Easily deployable using the provided Dockerfile.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Docker (if you want to run in a container)

*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation (using Docker)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd Omar-YYoussef-Audio_Music_splitter
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t audio-splitter .
    ```

3.  **Run the Docker container:**
    ```bash
    docker run -p 8501:8501 audio-splitter
    ```

    The app will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Installation (Locally)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
     git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd Omar-YYoussef-Audio_Music_splitter
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed on your system.* For Ubuntu/Debian systems, you can install it using:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
      ```
3.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    The app will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

The application has three main tabs:

### URL Processing 🔗

1.  Paste the URL of the video you want to process into the text input.
2.  Click the "Process URL" button.
3.  Wait for the video to be downloaded and processed.
4.  Download the processed video or the separated vocal track when prompted.

### Audio Processing 🎧
